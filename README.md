# EmplyManagement

TECHNOLOGY USED:

ABSTRACT:
A well planned, systematically executed industrial training helps a great deal in inculcating a good work culture. It provides a linkage between employees and the industry to develop awareness of the industrial approach to problem solving based on broad understanding of operations of the industrial organizations.

This project entitled “Employee Management System” has been designed towards improving the Management of Employee Information in the field offices. It maintains Employee records, Leave Records, Department, and other basic information of Employee. Various MIS reports can be generated through it viz. Leave Order, Employee record, Position and CR Status etc. This information is compiled and used at Headquarter Level for MIS purposes. The project has been an enriching experience for me in the field of programming and Enterprise Application development. The project has been developed to fulfill the requirements of the Employees in Labor Ministry.

The tools and technologies used for developing the software are Angular for frontend, Spring Boot for backend and MySQL for Database.
